# Why call it bush ?

it is a domain for me.


## what I will do ?

This is a machine learning package implement by C++. Although there is a mlpack for machine learning implement by C++, I just implement the basic algorithms for pratices.
I use C++ instead of python just want to pratice C++11. I'm a deeper user for C/C++. Actually, using python implement this algorithm is easy. But I don't known, I just wanto to use C++.

Maybe it is a mistake, but how care ? Just I.

Here some limits for this project.

1. C++11 language needed
2. eigen used, someone said that tensorflow using it

## how many algorithms here ?

I'm learning the *Machine learning in action*, so here just contains algorithms what the book contains. If you want to ask me Why it is *Machine learning in action*, because six months ago I recommanded to do some machine learning work. I just bounght a book for action and finish my work.

Every dictories is a algorithm, the detail please see the README.md if you want to use.

## about me

I love machine learning, I want to use those algorithms to make a change. Change what ? I don't knwon yet, maybe sort or personal recommendation.
